    description: `I am a Computer Science Engineering student (CGPA 9.0) at KIIT who has experience in AI, machine learning, and work on full-stack development. I develop scalable applications that solve real-world problems and deliver tangible results. My work includes projects like:

> Travel Itinerary Generator: 100 + monthly visitors
> Book Recommendation System: A web application that recommends books based on user choice.
> Weather Trend Analyzer: The service is a platform that visualizes real-time information.

    Got direct experience with open source by actively participating in Hacktoberfest 2022 and 2024 and GirlScript Summer of Code 2024. Passionate open-source developer with a track record of working collaboratively, bug fixes, documentation and code review.

    Energetic to develop AI based solutions which provide a practical solution to real world problems and deliver quantifiable business results. My vision is to attain optimal solutions of real-life problems using innovative technology.`,
